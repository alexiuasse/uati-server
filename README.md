# what-ill-eat

### The main goal in this project is just for fun

The idea is to have a app made in flutter that just choose what type of restaurant the person should order with django as background.

### Django - Background

The django will process randomically as much as possible (we all know that randomic things does not exist in computer matter), but he will also be able to store last results and some profile settings.
The last results will be used to allow or not (the user defines) a restaurant type to be choosed again.

### Flutter - App

The flutter app will be a frontend to user, allowing to add/edit a new restaurant type and get the result of what kind he/she will order, also he/she can control some settings of how the dice will rolled out.
One important thing is that if a user add a new restaurant type, it'll get attached to the user and none of the others users will be able to see or edit it.
